## **Backend Setup**

1. Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install flask flask-cors pandas pdfplumber pytesseract pdf2image
```

3. Configure paths for Tesseract and Poppler:

```python
TESSERACT_PATH = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"
POPPLER_PATH = r"C:\path\to\poppler\bin"
```

4. Run the Flask server:

```bash
python credit_parser.py
```

- Backend runs on `http://localhost:5000`
- `/parse` endpoint generates CSV
- `/parsed_credit_statements.csv` serves the parsed data

3. Open frontend (`npm start`).
4. Dashboard automatically fetches and displays analytics.
5. Optional: Upload a different CSV using the upload button.
6. Click on a statement card to view full details in a modal.

## **Notes**

- Handles both **text-based** and **scanned PDFs**.
- Missing fields in statements are handled gracefully (`N/A`).
- Bank colors and charts are dynamically assigned based on **bank name** in filename.
- CSV is the single source of truth for frontend display.
